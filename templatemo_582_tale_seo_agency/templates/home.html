                <p>As a part of our extended social reach program , EcoPeace has collaborated and connected with other companies with a similar vision to ours- if not in the environmental category, then in the social one. We want to be able to reach as many  people as possible from our target audience and achieve our beautiful vision : a step closer to peace, and an improved climate in our surroundings. </p>

<p>A little about one of our prestigious collaborators: 

One of our collaborations is with a European Studies program that is launched partly in Dusseldorf, Germany in the Heinrich Heine university. The program was founded in 2004 by Ambassador Avi Primor, together with HRH Prince El-Hassan bin Talal, who founded the Royal Scientific society in Amman, and Prof. Sari Nusseibeh, the president of Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem. 

The Master’s degree program in European Studies was launched in 2009, when the first group, consisting of 21 students from Israel and Palestine, arrived at the Heinrich-Heine university in dusseldorf, Germany. The students spent one year studying and living together in Germany, and under the condition that they successfully complete their studies, are then awarded a Master’s degree from the Heinrich-Heine university. Since 2010, Jordanian students from Amman have been taking part in the trilateral program as well. </p>


<p>Collaboration process:

In the context of our collaboration, EcoPeace has added classes to the schedule of these gifted students that educate them on the environmental situation in the Middle East, because they already study the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in great depth. Because both we and the European Studies program have similar visions, if not identical ones, we have benefited a lot from this collaboration- the students are more educated, they speak on our behalf many times in the events they’re invited to, and this way we have extended our reach. The European Studies program is given beneficial services from us, such as bringing our teams to speak to the students of the program and the university in general, and bringing groups of students who are willing from the university to experience the Middle East, its climates and its cultures.
